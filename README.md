# What is this project?

The goal of this project is to create a minecraft server hosting system which could potentially be used as a real product to rent out minecraft servers to other people. Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project via github; just fork the project and submit a pull request, and I'll try to give it a timely review when I get a chance. Try to keep pull requests small, and remember to tag any associated issue number if the pull request fixes or implements a specific issue.

# Building in Public

I'm trying to document this project via my youtube channel [https://www.youtube.com/c/webdevjunkie](https://www.youtube.com/c/webdevjunkie) on this specific youtube series found here: [https://bit.ly/minecraftvlogseries](https://bit.ly/minecraftvlogseries).

# Getting Started

This project is broken up into 3 main components: agent, api, and client. Each component has it's own package.json and will need to be setup and install individually. To get started, do the following:

- client: `cd client && npm i && npm start`
- server: `cd server && npm i && npm start`
- agent: `cd agent && npm i && npm start`

You will need the following installed in order for the agent to be able to run the minecraft servers and accept commands:

- docker (used for wrapping and hosting the minecraft server)
- socat (used for communicating via stdin to the running docker container)

In order to start and configure the postgresql database, follow these steps

- In the root folder run `docker-compose up -d`
- Inside `api` run `npx prisma migrate dev` in order to apply pending migrations

# Flows

Below are the various high level architecture flows that occur in our system, such as when someone rents a server, or when someone sends a command to the MC Docker container.
